# About
This contains version hashes (MD5, SHA1 and SHA256) for log4j2 versions. These include the patched version 2.15.0 as well as prior unpatched versions to allow you to identify both vulnerable .jar as well as inner class files.

Two directories exist 
* `modified-classes` which include those classes changed as part of the patch 
* `all-jars-and-classes` which includes all classes and their jars

we originally generated these on Sunday December 12th, 2021
